--WIPAC FALL 2017 HS INTERNSHIP--

Several high school students were invited to WIPAC to learn about and work on multimessenger likelihood analysis.

One of the great goals of neutrino astronomy is the identification of extra-solar and extra-galactic sources of neutrinos. Some of the best candidates for point neutrino sources are known gamma-ray sources. By comparing data collected from IceCube with the locations of known gamma-ray sources, we hope to find statistically significant correlations that suggest a source of neutrinos.

So far, we have worked with the TeVCAT gamma ray source catalog, as well as a sample of sources found by HAWC (the High Altitude Water Cherenkov).
